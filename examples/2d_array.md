# Simple Example

You'll need to create a regular-table

```html
<regular-table id="regularTable"></regular-table>
```

Let's start with with a simple data model, a two dimensional `Array`.  This one
is very small at 3 columns x 26 rows, but even for very small data sets,
`regular-table` won't read your entire dataset at once.  Instead, we'll need
to write a simple _virtual_ data model to access `DATA` and `COLUMN_NAMES`
indirectly.

```javascript
const DATA = [
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25],
    ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L", "M", "N", "O", "P", "Q", "R", "S", "T", "U", "V", "W", "X", "Y", "Z"],
    Array.from(Array(26).keys()).map((x) => x % 2 === 0),
];
```

When clipped by the scrollable viewport, you may end up with a `<table>` of just
a rectangular region of `DATA`, rather than the entire set.  A simple viewport
2x2 may yield this `<table>`:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>B</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

```json
{
    "num_rows": 26,
    "num_columns": 3,
    "data": [
        [0, 1],
        ["A", "B"]
    ]
}
```

Here's a an implementation for this simple _virtual_ data model,
the function `getDataSlice()`.  This function is called by your 
`<regular-table>` whenever it needs more data, with coordinate arguments,
`(x0, y0)` to `(x1, y1)`.  Only
this region is needed to render the viewport, so `getDataSlice()` returns 
this rectangular `slice` of `DATA`.  For the window (0, 0) to (2, 2),
`getDataSlice()` would generate an Object as above, containing the `data` slice,
as well as the overall dimensions of 
`DATA` itself ( `num_rows`, `num_columns`), for sizing the scroll area.  To
render this virtual data model to a regular HTML `<table>`, register this data
model via the `setDataListener()` method:

```javascript
function getDataSlice(x0, y0, x1, y1) {
    return {
        num_rows: DATA[0].length,
        num_columns: DATA.length,
        data: DATA.slice(x0, x1).map((col) => col.slice(y0, y1)),
    };
}
```

You can register and invoke this table thusly:

```javascript
window.regularTable.setDataListener(getDataSlice);
window.regularTable.draw();
```
